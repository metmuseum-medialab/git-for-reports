  GLAM Lab best practices

Abstract
========

  Come up with a repeatable, testable framework for running a lab in context of GLAM R&D

Indroduction
============

  Research labs inside museums will become more widespread and valuable.
  By establishing a base level of technology competency and common language, labs and museums as a whole will be able to better share knowledge and collaborate.
  In the first iteration of this lab, we will leverage git, a tool for managing changing documents, and github, a website for collaborating around those documents.

Hypothesis
==========

  Git forces accountability and keeps a full history of changes
  Github's pull request model encourages pier review and discussion

Materials and Methods
=====================


Procedure
=========

  * Have each team member sign up for github at http://github.com
  * Create a github organization for your lab
  * Add all the team members to the organization
  * Fork this experiment to the organization
  * Encourage members to comment on any confusing lines in the procedure
  * Have each member fork the repository and provide a pull request with their own results
    * Read the [lab report reference] when editing the report to better ensure the pull requests get merged
